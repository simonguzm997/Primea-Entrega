          My name is Simón Guzmán, I am 23 years old and live in Bogota. I was born in Armenia 
          in 1997 but was raised in Cali. My parents divorced when I was very young, so I grew up
           with my mom but would visit my dad at least once a week. When I was around 9 years 
           old, my mom married an Italia guy called Dario. Due to the marriage, I spent most 
           of my vacations in Italy and was finally able to see snow when I was there. 
        
        </p>
        

        <p>
          I’ve had animals all my life, but everything started with dogs. Before I was born, 
        my mom had two dogs called Simba and Chia. Then, when I was very little, Chia 
        had puppies and we kept one of them naming it Bruno. Some years later, while 
        taking Bruno to the park, we saw a Husky and I loved it so much, I asked my mom 
        from one. When she arrived, we called her Luna and she was a white fluffy ball. 
        A couple years ago, Dario talked to a guy who had a Samoyedo called Nicolas and 
        was going to be abandoned, so we adopted it. Nicolas and Luna had four puppies, we 
        gave three away and kept one I called Polinesio. Finally, a year ago my mom adopted a 
        dog called Lula who was being abused by her owner. 
        </p>
        
        <p>
          Simultaneously, I had lots of other pets. I had a hamster called Manchita who escaped 
          her cage every night. I had tree bunnies, sadly two of them dies very fast but the 
          third one bit my thumb once. I also had two canaries, one blue and one green that my 
          aunt gave me as she had a ton of them. Then, at an event in my school I won a chick, 
          sadly it dies in a couple of weeks. Now days, I have three cats. I adopted Pelusa and 
          Selena from a vet close to where I live as they where brother and sister, I decided not 
          to separate them. Finally, around one year later, I found a cat at the universities 
          parking lot. I asked around to see if she had an owner and no one knew about it, so I 
          took her home. Took her to the vet and she had no health issues. I put posters in the 
          area where I found her, with pictures and my number, in case her owner would appear, 
          but no one called so I kept her. 
        </p>
        <p>
          Now days, I’m studying computer engineer at Universidad de los Andes. 
          I hope to finish the career next year and start master’s in security, as it’s 
          the field that I love the most. If you are interested in contacting me, this in

         <h1>Hobbies</h1>
         <p>
          I am not a fan of drinking and because of this, I don’t enjoy much going to bars 
          or going out at night in general. I enjoy a lot more being at home and what something 
          on Netflix. I love watching anime, series and movies, as long as they have some comedy 
          in it. Right now I’m waiting on new episode for the series Lucifer in Netflix and I’m 
          slowly watching the nine hundred plus episodes of One Piece. I also enjoy gaming a lot,
           but mostly MMO’s. Not playing any currently as I feel the genre is not doing good 
           currently, but I have high expectations for an upcoming MMO called 
           Ashes of Creation.
